   <h2>WELCOME TO INDIA</h2>
  <p>India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[25] is a 
    country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous
     country, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, 
     the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan
      to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, 
      India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, 
      Myanmar, and Indonesia. The nation's capital city is New Delhi.</p>

    <h2>India Gate</h2>
   <p>The India Gate (formerly known as the All 
    India War Memorial) is a war memorial located astride 
    the Rajpath on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, 
    formerly called Kingsway. It stands as a memorial to 84,000 soldiers of the British 
    Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders,
     Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, 
     and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers
      from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.[2] Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate
       evokes the architectural style of the memorial arch such as the Arch of Constantine, in Rome, 
       and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai</p>
